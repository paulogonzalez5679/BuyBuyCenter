*Buybuy Center* 
This project is very significant for me since it was the first one that I carried out at a macro level, since I put into practice several of my knowledge, additionally it helped many micro-enterprises and ventures to be able to sell their products despite the pandemic that we were experiencing. .
This project also involved teamwork, in order to solve it on time, several activities were generated and several disciplines were agreed, such as the marketing, design, development, QA and infrastructure team, as such 1 person could belong to several teams, so Understanding each other was easier and knowing what we needed at a certain time, in addition to all this, seeing that it is scalable gave us more ideas such as a catalog of virtual reality and augmented reality products and others.
Work with servers, streaming services and security for transfers when purchases are made, development in Angular and as a database and additional services I work with FireBase

This project is called buy buy center, it was born as a result of the pandemic, it is a virtual shopping center, oriented to e-commerce, on this web platform the people who own shops could create their stands or virtual stores to promote their products.
Within the platform there are categories of stands classified and ordered based on their name and their products, in addition to this, within each stand there are store advertising and a pdf containing the catalog of the products they sell, not all stands contain the PDF file but everyone has a contact number to communicate directly by WhatsApp.
An essential functionality of the project was the streaming of sales, people could make live broadcasts through YouTube or Facebook and rebroadcast them on the buy buy center platform, and within these streamings people interested in buying could generate comments in real time. to request information about the products and make your purchases.

There are 3 roles, buyers, sellers and the administrator, as such the buyer is a natural person, the seller is the owner of a stand and the administrator is the one who controls the entire system, for this there is an administrative panel based on the user's role.
